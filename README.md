# FDM (freedownloadmanager) AppImage for most linux distros.

Free Download Manager is a download manager for Windows, macOS, Linux and Android. For linux the company only offer a debian binary.

FDM was initially proprietary software, but was free and open-source software between versions 2.5 and 3.9.7. Starting with version 3.0.852 (15 April 2010), the source code was made available in the project's Subversion repository instead of being included with the binary package. This continued until versions 3.9.7 .The source code for version 5.0 and newer is not available and the GNU General Public License agreement has been removed from the app. Due to this, I cannot provide you with releases of FDM AppImages. Instead you could easily build AppImages with the above recipe file and instructions on all linux distros.
